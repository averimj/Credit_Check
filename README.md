# Questions

1. What are you proud of?
    That I got as far as I did and I worked really hard.

1. What do you need to improve?
    Everything. Even though I got further than I thought I would've...I didn't finish and there's still of stuff to learn.

1. What questions do you still have?
    I'm trying to check my test but when I run the program, I get an error:
              ...Kernel_require.rb:55:in 'require'  
    Why is that?

## Functionality - 2

Notes:

- [ ] Student completes through Iteration 3


## Mechanics - 3

Notes:

The student(s):

- [x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [ ] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [x] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [x] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [ ] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design - 3

Notes:

The student(s):

- [ ] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [ ] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [x] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [x ] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing - 1

Notes:

The student(s):

- [ ] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [x ] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [ ] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [x] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [ ] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control - 2

Notes:

The student(s):

- [ ] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [ ] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [ ] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
